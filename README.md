<div class="rendered-markdown"><h3>Getting started</h3>
<p>There are various things you can do to quickly and efficiently configure your Codio Box to your exact requirements.</p>
<h3>GUI Applications and the Virtual Desktop</h3>
<p>The Virtual Desktop allows you auto develop GUI based applications using any programming language. You can install a Virtual Desktop in your Box. You can then start the desktop and view it within the Codio IDE or in a new browser tab.</p>

<h3>Command line access and the Terminal window</h3>
<p>All Codio Boxes provide sudo level privileges to the underlying Ubuntu server. This means you can install and configure any component you like. You access the terminal from the <strong>Tools->Terminal</strong> menu item.</p>
<h3>Debugger</h3>
<p>The Codio IDE comes with a powerful visual debugger. Currently we support Python, Java, C, C++ and NodeJS. Other languages can be added on request.</p>

<h3>Content authoring and assessments</h3>
<p>Codio comes with a very powerful content authoring tool, Codio Guides. Guides is also where you create all forms of auto-graded assessments.</p>

</ul>
<h3>Templating Box configurations and projects</h3>
<p>Codio offers two very powerful templating options so you can create new projects from those templates with just a couple of clicks. <strong>Stacks</strong> allow you to create snapshots of the Boxâ€™s underlying software configuration. You can then create new projects from a Stack avoiding having to configure anew each time you start a new project. <strong>Starter Packs</strong> allow you to template an entire project, including workspace code.</p>

</ul>
<h3>Install software</h3>
<p>You can always install software onto your Box using the command line. However, Codio offers a shortcut for commonly installed components that can be accessed from the <strong>Tools->Install Software</strong> menu.</p>
<p>We can easily add new items to the Install Software screen, so feel free to submit requests.</p>
